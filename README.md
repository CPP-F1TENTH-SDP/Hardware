# Cal Poly Pomona F1TENTH Project: Hardware Files and Documentation 
Welcome to Cal Poly Pomona's F1TENTH SDP Group. Here is where we posted any hardware files and documentation that were used throughout the project. The hardware was based on a modified list of items that the official F1Tenth website has 
[layed out](https://f1tenth.org/build.html).
